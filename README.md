# Reverse-Shell-Command-Generator
A tool to generate your reverse shell payloads immediatly instead of searching the web or changing host/port later on.

## Usage

Clone the repo to your local system and make the rev_shell_gen bash script executable.\
Run the script with 2 arguements.
1st argument --> `IP`\
2nd argument --> `PORT`

Eg: ./rev_shell_gen 192.168.1.45 4444\

Choose a lanaguage option which is needed(Eg:python,bash etc).
Languages offered:\
```
Python
Bash
PHP
```
More languages would be implemented later on.\
You would get 2 or 3 payloads for that specific language as your output.\
