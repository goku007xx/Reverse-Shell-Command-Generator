# Reverse-Shell-Command-Generator

A tool to generate your reverse shell payloads immediatly instead of searching the web or changing host/port later on.



## Usage



Clone the repo to your local system and run the rev_shell_gen bash script with 2 arguments.\

1st argument --> `IP`\

2nd argument --> `PORT`\



Eg: ./rev_shell_gen 192.168.1.45 4444\



Choose a lanaguage option which is needed(Eg:python,bash etc).\

Languages offered:\

```

Python

Bash

PHP

```

More languages would be implemented later on.\

You would get 2 or 3 payloads for that specific language as your output.\
